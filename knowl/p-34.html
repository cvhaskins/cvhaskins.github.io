<p>In a relatively simple (keep in mind that <em class="emphasis">simple</em> means that it is not overly complicated with a large number of steps, not that it is easy) expression, a reasonable order of operations may look much the same for everyone. In <em class="emphasis">complex</em> expressions, involving a large number of steps to expand and condense to what might be considered its ``simplified'' form, you might be able to find a reasonable order of operations that is perfectly correct, but different than how someone else approached it. Like with many things in mathematics, there is not always a <em class="emphasis">single correct solution</em>, though there may be <em class="emphasis">best solution</em> or what you consider to be the <em class="emphasis">easiest solution</em>. The terms ``best'' and ``easiest'' are subjective, and oftentimes up to the person doing the mathematics.</p>
