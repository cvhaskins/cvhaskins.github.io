<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eighty-miles.html" title="Figure 3.0.1">FigureÂ 3.0.1</a>, the mathematician in the video was able to solve the problem only after the question was restated. At first, they were asked "If you are going 80 miles per hour, how long does it take you to go 80 miles?" After awhile, they are asked "If you are going 80 miles per hour, so an hour at 80 miles, so how long will it take you to go 80 miles?" This reframing is often an important step to solve problems, but we do not always have another person there to do it for us. Instead, we should practice reframing for ourselves.</p>
