Identify the parts that were done differently between the solutions and determine if one solution is a better fit than the other. Were more tutors able to have their preferences met in one solution over the other? Are all the busiest times appropriately covered by enough tutors? What else should be used as criteria for what would make the "best" solution?</article></body>
