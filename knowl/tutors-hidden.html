<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like">You are assigned to schedule tutors for the Math Center's yellow room (where College Algebra and PreCalculus Trig students go for studying help). The busiest days tend to be Tuesday and Wednesday at around 12pm to 4pm, where at least 3 to 4 tutors should be scheduled, while other times (for the sake of this example, let's say that they are open from 9AM to 5PM, Monday through Friday) are either empty or not so busy that one or two tutors can't cover the entire room. There are 10 tutors to schedule and each has their own course schedule and preferences. The maximum number of hours a tutor can work in the Math Center is 20 hours. Using the table of information below with each tutor's class schedule and preferences, create their weekly schedule for the semester. <figure class="table table-like"><figcaption><span class="type">Table</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">11.1.4<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span></figcaption><div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">
