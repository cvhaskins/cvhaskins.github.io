  <title>Perseverance</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>An important aspect of problem solving is being able to persevere through challenging problems. Perseverance does not look like pushing through to the end while ignoring any red flags that come up along the way, rather it looks like stopping to consider red flags and considering a new path, only moving forward when it makes sense to do so. Perseverance sometimes looks like turning back to a previous step. Perseverance oftentimes looks like starting over. </p>

    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>In Calculus, one must do a variety of complex things. Sometimes, the "aftermath" is using basic and intermediate algebra in order to simplify something rather ugly. Given the function <m>f(x) = (2x-3)^2(x^2+x+1)^</m>, using the Chain Rule for Derivatives in a Calculus class would give us this derivative:
        <me>f'(x) = (2x-3)^23(x^2+x+1)^2(2x+1)+(x^2+x+1)^32(2x-3)2</me>
        This is not the way we'd want to look at this answer, though, in using it moving forward. Instead, we might want it to be a list of individual terms (a.k.a. expanded and "simplified"). Expand and simplify <m>f'(x)</m>.</p></statement>
        <hint>Try considering small chunks at a time. You could expand the first term <me>(2x-3)^23(x^2+x+1)^2(2x+1)</me> separately from the second term <me>(x^2+x+1)^32(2x-3)2</me> and within each term, do small steps at a time. For example, in the first term, try expanding <m>(2x-3)^2</m>, then multplying the result by <m>3</m>, then multiplying that result by <m>2x+1</m>, etc.</hint>
    <answer><m>f'(x) = 32x^7 - 18x^5-85x^4-24x^3+9x^2+44x+15</m></answer>
    <solution>There are many different ways to go about expanding and simplifying <m>f'(x)</m>. It is up to you to find a solution which makes sense to you without breaking any rules. Keep working.</solution>

    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>There are many applications in which we are told information using one unit, say days, but in order to use this information we need it be in a different unit, say hours. We can use relationships between equivalent numbers in order change the given information into a usable format. If I take a road trip where I average 1500 miles per day, and I'd like to see my average speed in mph, I can use a method called dimensional analysis and the relationship between days and hours:
        <me>\dfrac{1500\textnormal{ miles}}{1\textnormal{ day}}\cdot \dfrac{1\textnormal{ day}}{24\textnormal{ hours}}</me>
        To find my speed in mph, I cancel out both units and numbers where possible, and simplify this to <m>62.5</m> mph.</p>
        <p>Let's say that a worker is able to build a short 4-ft tall garden fence on their own at a rate of about 6 inches (the width of a panel) per minute. Determine the rate the fence is built in yards per hour, then determine how many hours it will take to build a fence that is 45 yards long.  </p></statement>
    <hint>Take things one step at a time. You don't need to convert inches straight to yards, you could convert to feet first. You don't need to convert both length and time in the same step, you can do one and then the other.</hint>
    <solution>You got this. Look for things that stick out. Work with someone else. Turn back to a previous step. Ask for help. Take a break, but don't give up.</solution></example>
    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>Solve the equation: 
        <me>0=x^{2/3}+5x^{1/3}+6</me></p></statement>
    <hint>This equation looks almost quadratic, but the <m>x^{1/3}</m> is in the way. Try saying that <m>w=x^1/3</m> and solve for <m>w</m> first.</hint>
        <answer><m>x={8,27}</m></answer>
    <solution>There are a number of ways to solve this problem. Find one that makes sense to you.</solution></example>
    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>We don't know things about trigonometry, but we can use the idea of substituting symbols in for scary looking things to reduce a trigonometric expression. Here are some rules: 
        <me>    \sec\theta = \dfrac{1}{\cos\theta} \hspace{.5in} \csc\theta = \dfrac{1}{\sin\theta}</me>
            <me>\tan\theta = \dfrac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} \hspace{.5in} \cot\theta = \dfrac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta} </me>
        Use these to reduce:
        <me>\dfrac{\csc\theta\cos\theta+\cot\theta}{\sec\theta\cot\theta}</me>
        Write your answer in terms of <m>\theta</m></p></statement>
    <hint>Try saying that <m>\sin\theta=A</m> and <m>\cos\theta=B</m>.</hint>
    <answer><m>2\cos\theta</m></answer></example>
