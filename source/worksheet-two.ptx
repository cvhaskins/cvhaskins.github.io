    A <term>polynomial expression</term> is an expression with at least one term, exponents on variables that are non-negative integers (like counting numbers), and coefficients that are any real number. The following are examples of polynomial expressions with variables represented by symbols: 
        <ul>
        <li><m>k-5</m></li>
        <li><m>m^2 - 5m + 6</m></li>
        <li><m>-7\heartsuit+7\heartsuit^6-9\heartsuit^2</m></li>
        <li><m>(x-4)(3x-4)^2(x+2)^3</m></li></ul>

        <introduction>
            <p>The <term>Greatest Common Factor</term> is the largest factor which can be ``factored out'' of each term. A <term>factor</term> is something which can multiply with other factors to create the term. For example: 
                <ul>
                <li>3 has factors: -1, 1, -3, 3</li>
                <li>4 has factors: -1, 1, -2, 2, -4, 4</li>
                <li>12 has factors: -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, -4, 4, -6, 6, -12, 12</li>
                <li><m>9\heartsuit^2</m> has factors: -1, 1, -3, 3, -9, 9, <m>-\heartsuit</m>, <m>\heartsuit</m>, <m>-3\heartsuit</m>, <m>3\heartsuit</m>, <m>-9\heartsuit</m>, <m>9\heartsuit</m>, <m>-\heartsuit^2</m>, <m>\heartsuit^2</m>, <m>-3\heartsuit^2</m>, <m>3\heartsuit^2</m>, <m>-9\heartsuit^2</m>, <m>9\heartsuit^2</m></li></ul>

            <title>How to Factor the GCF</title>
            <statement><p>
                In a polynomial expression like <m>-7\heartsuit+7\heartsuit^6-9\heartsuit^2</m>, factoring out the GCF means knowing the factors of each term <em>and</em> what the greatest combination of factors from each term could be. Find the GCF and factor it out.
                </p></statement>
            <hint>Factoring the GCF is like dividing it from each term, but it doesn't ``go away'' like it might in a division problem. Factoring is the opposite of distribution.</hint>
            <answer><p>>GCF is <m>\heartsuit</m> or <m>-\heartsuit</m>, so the factored version of the expression could then be <m>\heartsuit(-7+7\heartsuit^5-9\heartsuit)</m> or <m>-\heartsuit(7-7\heartsuit^5+9\heartsuit)</m> </p></answer></example>

        <title>Factoring by Grouping</title>
            <introduction><p>Factoring by grouping is a way to factor out "groups of terms" at a time, instead of a single factor. This method of factoring utilizes the GCF. </p>
            <example>
                <title>An Example of Grouping</title>
                <statement>For example, we want to factor the polynomial expression <m>8r^3 - 64r^2 + r - 8</m>, we can see that it does not have a GCF besides <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m>. We might be able to factor by grouping.
                    <ol marker="(a)"><li>We'll start with "grouping" the terms. Rewrite the expression, but with some indication that <m>8r^3</m> and <m>-64r^2</m> are in the same group and that <m>r</m> and <m>-8</m> are in the same group.</li>
                        <li>Factor the GCF out of the first group, then factor the GCF out of the second group.</li>
                        <li>If we have chosen our groups well <em>and</em> our polynomial expression is factorable, the two terms (our factored groups) will have the same multiplier. What is it?</li>
                <li>If the polynomial expression is factorable, we should now be able to factor that multiplier out of both terms, like we did in the last exercise from the last exercise in <xref ref="GCF-example"/>. </li></ol>

        <title>Factoring with the AC Method</title>
            <introduction><p>Some polynomials (usually a trinomial, or a binomial with highest exponent of 2 on its variable) may need a different factoring method. This method of factoring utilizes the method of grouping within it.</p></introduction>
            <example>
            <title>Example of the AC Method</title>
            <statement><p>For example, if we want to factor the trinomial <m>5x^2+7x+2</m>, we can see that there is not a GCF aside from <m>1</m> or <m>-1</m>, and there are only three terms, so we cannot get groups of two terms at a time. To get to the point where we can use the method of grouping, we need to have an even number of terms.</p>
                <ol marker="(a)"><li>This method is called "the AC Method" because it begins by thinking of the polynomial as <m>Ax^2+Bx+C</m> and multiplying the <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> together. What is <m>AC</m>?</li>
                    <li>Find all possible combinations of numbers which multiply to get <m>AC</m></li>
                    <li>Choose from your list the pair which also adds to get B (or in this case, 7).</li>
                    <li>Split the middle term into two represented by these numbers. The expression should be equivalent to what you were given, but should now have four terms.</li>
                    <li>If everything was done well and the polynomial is factorable, you may now factor by grouping.</li></ol></statement></example>
            <p>Note that the AC Method is also used when <m>A=1</m>, but is streamlined by the idea of finding a pair of numbers which multiply to get <m>C</m> and add to get <m>B</m>.</p>

    <title>Converting Between Graphical and Numerical Information</title>
        <introduction><p>In addition to verbal and algebraic information, you may need to take in or produce graphic or numerical representations of mathematical information. For example, consider the coordinate plane below with three labeled points.
            <image source="time-one-time-two-time-three" width="60%">
        <description> A coordinate plane with three labeled points. The point labeled Time 1 is 1 unit to the right of the vertical axis and 3 units up from the horizontal axis. The point labeled Time 2 is 2 units to the right of the vertical axis and 5 units up from the horizontal axis. The point labeled Time 3 is 3 units to the right and about 7.25 units up. </description>
            </image>
            You are asked to describe this graphical information in numerical form. Typically, this means that you will create a table to summarize the information. Because this graph is three discrete (or separate) points, this summary will be easier to create than if the graph were a full curve. We can either represent the table vertically:
            <table>
            <tabular>
                <row><cell><m>x</m></cell> 
                <cell><m> y </m></cell>
                </row>
                <row><cell>1</cell>
                <cell>3</cell>
                </row>
                <row><cell>2</cell>
                <cell>5</cell>
                <row><cell>3</cell>
                    <cell>7.25</cell></row></row></tabular></table>
            or horizontally:
            <table>
            <tabular>
                <row><cell><m>x</m></cell>
                <cell>1</cell>
                <cell>2</cell>
                <cell>3</cell>
                </row>
                <row><cell><m>y</m></cell>
                <cell>3</cell>
                <cell>5</cell>
                <cell>7.25</cell></row></tabular></table>
            Note that choosing <m>x</m> to represent the horizontal component and <m>y</m> to represent the vertical component isn't necessary. You might instead see function notation, like <m>x</m> and <m>f(x)</m>, or any combination of symbols as relevant to the context of the graph.
