  <title>Challenge Workshop #1 </title>
  <introduction>
    <p>This chapter is not about seeing new things, but doing new things with topics you've seen before. You will be asked to take on two challenging tasks; one involving algebraic and numeric representations of mathematics, the other involving verbal and graphical representations of mathematics.</p>

    <title>Converting Between Algebraic and Numeric Representations</title>
    <example xml:id="alg-to-num">
        <statement>
        <p>
            You are given the following algebraic representation for a function: 
            <me>f(x) = \dfrac{5x-3}{x^2-4}</me></p>
        <p>Your challenge is to give me a numeric representation (a table) that has enough points that I'd be able to make a graph of it that is relatively accurate. You will not be allowed to graph it, only choose appropriate points to include in your table. You may choose the number of points to include, what the inputs are, then find the outputs using the algebraic representation.</p></statement></example>
        <example>
        <statement>
            <p>Using your numeric representation from <xref ref="alg-to-num"/>, what would you expect <m>f(38)</m> to be? What about <m>f(-2)</m>? Can you estimate whether the average rate of change between <m>f(3)</m> and <m>f(48)</m> is positive or negative?</p></statement>

    <title>Converting Between Verbal and Graphical Representations</title>
    <example>
        <statement>
        <p>You are given the following list of facts about a situation which can be modeled by a function. 
            <ul>
            <li>We are measuring the number of bacteria in a culture, measuring time in minutes as the input.</li>
            <li>At 5 minutes, we measure there to be 40 bacteria in the culture.</li>
            <li>The average rate of change from 5 minutes to 55 minutes is 16 bacteria per minute.</li>
            <li>Growth of the bacteria slows to almost constant between 60 minutes and 90 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 2 hours, the bacteria can no longer be supported by their environment and begin to die off.</li>
            <li>At 3 hours, we measure there to be 40 live bacteria in the culture.</li>
            <li>At 4 hours, we measure there to be 0 live bacteria in the culture.</li>
            </ul>
            Create a graph for a function which satisfies all of these facts.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>We are keeping track of the height of the ball after being thrown. It reaches a maximum height of 12 feet, then lands on the ground at 6 seconds, 9 seconds, 11 seconds, and 12 seconds.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>You want to keep track of good deeds, starting with yourself. You do good deeds for two people you know and ask them to do the same. Assuming all people do their two good deeds, the input is measured in how far down the line the favors are "paid forward", while the output is measured in number of good deeds done.</p>

                <description>A coordinate plane, graphing a cubic polynomial with a y-intercept of 10, growing to an output of 30 at an input of 3, decreasing to an output of about 17 at an input of about 8.3, and increasing afterwards. The graph stops at an input of about 11 with an output of about 32.</description>

                Suppose that the graph above represents the amount of revenue, in billions of dollars, of iPads where the input is years since 2010.
