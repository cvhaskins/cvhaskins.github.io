  <title>Expanding and Condensing Expressions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this class, a <term>linear expression</term> involves up to a single variable with its highest exponent at one. The variable might be represented by any number of non-numeric symbols, typically letters (Latin or Greek) like <m>x</m> or <m>\alpha</m>, but may be represented by any symbol you wish, like <m>\bigstar</m> or <m>\heartsuit</m>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of linear expressions include <me>
        3x - 5</me> and
        <me>
        9-4x</me> and 
        <me>
        \dfrac{3^2 - 4x +6x - \frac{3}{2}}{10}</me>

    <title>Condensing Linear Expressions</title>
    <p>
      You may be wondering why the last example of a linear expression is considered as such if it involves both exponents and fractions. The definition for a linear expression did not include either. There are a few reasons why this expression is linear: 
        <ul>
        <li>the highest exponent of the <em>variable</em> is one</li>
        <li>the numbers in the linear expression may be any constant we can think of, including fractions</li>
        <li>the division is by a number, not a variable</li></ul>
        We can see these things in action if we use a reasonable order of operations to condense the expression into a format with a single constant and a single variable term. </p>

    <p>
      Some expressions may not be linear, using exponents other than one on numerous variables. Note that using multiple variables does not necessarily make the expression non-linear, but involving elements like <m>x^2</m>, <m>\sqrt{\alpha}</m>, and <m>\dfrac{1}{\heartsuit}</m> are <em>certainly</em> non-linear when <m>x</m>, <m>\alpha</m>, <m>\heartsuit</m> are variable. This does not change how we address using a reasonable order of operations for expanding or condensing a complicated expression. The only alteration might be additional considerations for what it means to combine ``like terms''.

    <conclusion>
    <p>In a relatively simple (keep in mind that <em>simple</em> means that it is not overly complicated with a large number of steps, not that it is easy) expression, a reasonable order of operations may look much the same for everyone. In <em>complex</em> expressions, involving a large number of steps to expand and condense to what might be considered its ``simplified'' form, you might be able to find a reasonable order of operations that is perfectly correct, but different than how someone else approached it. Like with many things in mathematics, there is not always a <em>single correct solution</em>, though there may be <em>best solution</em> or what you consider to be the <em>easiest solution</em>. The terms ``best'' and ``easiest'' are subjective, and oftentimes up to the person doing the mathematics.</p></conclusion>

    <title>Converting Between Algebraic and and Verbal Representations of Information</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>If I told you that my dog eats 24 ounces of dog food per day, we'd be able to determine how much dog food she's consumed by the end of a typical week by creating an algebraic version of this relationship. It is best to define my input variable and units as well as my output variable and units. In this case, let's use <m>c</m> for <em>consumed</em> as the output variable to represent the number of ounces she consumes each day. We can use <m>d</m> to represent <em>days</em> since we've started counting her food consumption as the input variable. This means that the relationship looks like <me>c=24d \text{ ounces of dog food consumed, where } d \text{ is days since counting her food consumption.}</me> Notice that saying <m>c=24d</m> isn't quite enough, since <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> don't hold meaning or context on their own. Even in the algebraic version, we need to use some words to describe what we are doing. The algebriac version above is what's called a <term>model</term> of the real-world information in algebraic form.</p>

        <title>Solving Linear Equations</title>
    <introduction>
        <p> A <term>linear equation</term> is an equation which sets two linear expressions equal to each other. The linear equation may have a single variable, like <me> 3(x-5)+2x = \dfrac{1}{2}x - 5</me> or have multiple variables like 
            <me>y=5x+6</me> and

        </p>
        <p>Solving linear equations might include expanding or condensing the expressions on either side, but will also include what is often referred to as ``algebraic manipulations'', or performaning a certain operation on both sides of the equation simultaneously. This means each subsequent step of the solution is equivalent to the last.</p>
