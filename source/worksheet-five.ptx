  <title>Converting Algebraic Forms</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>So far, we've practiced converting algebraic forms of mathematical information into and out of numerical and verbal forms. We'll now focus on graphical forms. You may choose to use graphical transformations of library functions or first converting to a numerical form, as needed.</p>
  </introduction>
    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>Consider the algebraic form: 
        <me>f(x) = \dfrac{\sqrt{3x-4}}{x+5}</me>
        Sketch a graph of <m>y_1=\sqrt{3x-4}</m> and another graph of <m>y_2=x+5</m>. How might each output of <m>y_1</m> change by getting divided by each output of <m>y_2</m>?</p>
        <p>Now convert <m>f(x)</m> into numerical form and plot the points on a graph. Does the image make sense based on what you see of <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m>?</p>
        </statement>
    </example>
    <exercises>
    <exercisegroup>
        <introduction><p>For each of the following algebraic forms for functions below, sketch a graph of the function. </p></introduction>
        <exercise>
        <statement><p><m>g(t) = -3(t-8)^2+6</m></p>
            </statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
        <statement><p><m>h(r) = \sqrt{r^2-8}+5</m>
            </p></statement>
        </exercise>
        </exercisegroup></exercises>
    <example>
    <statement>
        <p>Consider the graph below: 
        <image source="graph-to-alg" width="60%">
            <description>A cubic function with the "twist" at the point (5, -2) and other points at (6,1) and (4,-1).</description>
            </image>
        This looks like a function that is not in our Library of Functions, but is very common. It looks almost like <m>y=x^3</m>, but graphically transformed. How can you use this to create an algebraic form for the graphed function? Do so.</p>
        </statement>
    </example>
    <exercises>
    <exercisegroup>
        <introduction><p>For each of the graphed functions below, convert them to algebraic form.</p>
        </introduction>
        <exercise>
        <statement><p>
            <image source="sqrt" width="60%">
            <description>A square root function with "origin" at the point (3,1), x-intercept at the point (2,0), and another point at (-1,-1).</description>
            </image></p>
            </statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
        <statement>
            <p>
            <image source="squared" width="60%">
                <description>A squared function with vertex at the point (0,-2) and another point at (1,3).</description>
                </image></p>
